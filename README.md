- Your timeline shifts smoothly between desktop and mobile, showing that you understand how to build for all screen sizes! 📱This adaptability is crucial since users expect the same quality experience no matter the device. Great job bringing this together! 🖥️

- Your hover effects are fantastic as they allow the milestone cards to reveal extra details in a way that feels interactive and engaging (that is SMOOTHHHH, fantastic job here)! 🎉 This mirrors how modern websites use interactivity to capture attention and improve user experience. Lovely implementation here! 📂

- The page styling feels slightly not aligned with the current layout (though I am LOVING that dynamic background, that is so cool) as some of the text is hugging the sides of the page, some spacing is a little uneven, and some batches of text seems centered while others are not (though I know this can be tricky)! Try using/adjusting your CSS variables for font sizes, margins, and colors to maintain company alignment and polish across the site. You can do this! 📏​

- This is just a suggestion, but you could try adding in a border perhaps around those images for a nice POP of color! You could maybe do one of the blues you have on page currently!
